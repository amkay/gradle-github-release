A https://gradle.org/[Gradle] plugin that uploads build artifacts into https://github.com[GitHub] releases.



[[usage]]
== Usage

Include the following in the project on which you want to apply the plugin:

[source,groovy,subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.github.amkay:gradle-github-release:{version}'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.github.amkay.github-release'
----

NOTE: The latest build of the current development version can always be obtained from https://github.com/amkay/gradle-github-release/tree/gh-pages/develop[here].


[[configuration]]
=== Configuration

The plugin registers an extension object named `githubRelease` that is the entry point to the configuration.
It also provides a DSL for keyword-based configuration, but configuration via properties is also possible.
The following example shows all configuration options:

[source,groovy]
----
githubRelease {
  // TODO
}
----
